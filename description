This project aims to develop an AR mobile app that can guide users through historical sites or museums, providing real-time information and immersive experiences. 
By overlaying digital information onto the real-world view, 
the app will enhance the visitor's understanding and engagement with the physical space
Key Features:

Marker-Based Tracking:
Use image markers placed at various points of interest to trigger AR content.
Detect markers using the device's camera and overlay relevant 3D models, text, or videos.
GPS-Based Tracking:
Utilize GPS coordinates to trigger AR experiences based on the user's location.
Display contextual information, such as historical facts, nearby attractions, or directions.
3D Model Rendering:
Integrate 3D models of historical artifacts or virtual reconstructions to provide immersive experiences.
Optimize models for real-time rendering on mobile devices.
Audio and Video Playback:
Incorporate audio narration and video clips to enhance the storytelling aspect of the AR experience.
Use spatial audio to create a more immersive soundscape.
User Interaction:
Allow users to interact with AR content through gestures or touch input.
Enable users to share their AR experiences on social media.
Technology Stack:

AR Framework:
Unity with AR Foundation: A powerful and versatile framework for creating AR experiences.
ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android): Native AR frameworks for platform-specific optimizations.
